# Cyber Security Training

## Rules:
1. Be open minded
2. Share something cool that you found
3. Take notes on this github repo
4. Think outside the box
5. Mindset: ready to learn

## How this works:
- when you first get to this repo, go to "exercises" and follow the instructions to get familiar with github
- After you do a basic github exercise then going forward whenever you add more notes to this document, you create a new branch and start taking notes. When you're done, you'll do:
1. ```"git status"```
2. ```"git add ."```
3. ```git commit -m "type a message here on what you worked on"```
4. ```git push origin branch-name-that-you-created```

### The purpose:
- The purpose is to get familiar with working as a team and familiar with github. We all will learn together and teach each other new techniques. Help each other out.
